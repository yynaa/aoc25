# day 4

## original solution

today was uninteresting, and i couldn't be motivated to actually optimize this, so i'm done for today.

## graph solution

i couldn't stop thinking about this, and within the next hour or so, i made a new solution with graphs.  

so, it turns out the parsing is slower, but going through the rolls is a lot faster with this method.  
silver is slower, but gold is faster!

### stats 

silver: 32ms -> 46ms
gold: 620ms -> 101ms
