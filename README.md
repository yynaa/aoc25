# Advent of Code 2025

this year, i'm bored. most of my projects are cool, but i need something lighter to work on for the beginning of december
(coming out of Anim'Est probably didn't help)

Gleam is my choice this year, it looked fun, i like Haskell's principles but hate its syntax, i like Rust (can't you tell?), so this came a bit obvious

a journal for each day can be found in the appropriate folder
